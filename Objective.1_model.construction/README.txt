This folder was updated on 2022/06/20 with the following changes:
- Scripts were moved around such that only the scripts that were/will be used in the manuscript are in the main folder; all others were moved to z_archived_sims
- Scripts were renamed and given simpler names
- Each script was curated to streamline the process. Specifically:
	- Load samples instead of simulating a new population each time
	- Generate the correct output files and name appropriately
- The Data viz scripts were made specific to the output files generated for this objective
