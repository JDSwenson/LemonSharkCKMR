Ok. Trying to get this file structure stuff figured out.
Now, put scripts that are working into the scripts/working directory. This will hold reference scripts.
Copy scripts that I'm testing into the scripts/currently_testing folder.

Keep all scripts in the 02_IBS/scripts folder and record them in the Simulation_log excel sheet. 
Put shortcuts for scripts currently being run in the main 02_IBS folder.

CKMR_IBS_CURRENT_03.01.2021 gives better results for males than the version on 03.02.2021.

The primary (only?) difference between the two scripts is that the version from 03.02 filters out SAMPLES that are full sibs while the version from 03.01 filters COMPARISONS.
