These simulations were conducted with the seed set at 444777 to test the effects of sampling before and after the mortality function in the fishSim loop.

Why?
Our estimates are positively biased. This means the model expects more relatives than what we're finding. Because first year mortality is higher compared to other years, I suspect the problem may be caused by sampling after animals have died and aged in a given year. In other words, we're more likely to miss relatives if half the sampled animals from a cohort die prior to being sampled (YOY survival = 0.55).
