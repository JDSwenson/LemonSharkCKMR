Updated model so population growth for males and females was fixed on the actual observed population growth.

Fit three models:
1.1 Separate estimates for males and females; population growth fixed separately for males and females based on observed values in fishSim
1.2 Separate estimates for males and females; populaton growth fixed at the observed value for the entire populaton
2.1 Combined estimates for the sexes; population growth fixed at the observed value for the entire population
